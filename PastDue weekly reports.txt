Week 1: 6/1 - 6/3 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	My first week mainly consisted of getting set-up at my desk and in the computer systems of the company.
I got an email account a slack account and a network wide username that I can use to gain access to 
certain things like my personal time card file.  I was introduced around the office to pretty much 
everyone (all developers and operations personel like finance).  I was also given a few books to read 
and was told to read a bit while at work as part of the internship so I began reading some during this
first week.  This is pretty much all Did the first week since it was a short week and I was just getting
started. 


Week 2: 6/6 - 6/10 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	This week was interesting mainly because of the CSM course that I got to take, for free!  
CSM stands for Certified Scrum Master and I got to learn all about the basics of being a scrum master
and using scrum in Agile porduct development over a two day course.  Each day of the course took up the 
full work day and was very informative. Its also a very expensive course but because I am an intern,
they let me take it for free.  Which is awesome. After the course I took a test and passed to become
a certified scrum master which is good for two years I believe.  I took a lot from the class and was very 
excited to see the priciples and ideas that were taught in the class utilized by the developers at 
the company, whom I started to work with the following week.


Week 3: 6/13 - 6/17 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
	This week I began paticipating in daily standups which are part of agile development.  A standup is
a quick, usually ten minute, meeting where each team member goes around and says what they worked on the
day before, what they plan on working on that day, and if they have any inpediments keeping them from 
progressing any further.  These were cool to witness because it was clear from the very start that 
the standups were beneficial for the team.  It made everyone's progress clear to everyone else on the team,
which allows for smooth progress on the product.  Any problems that occur during the development 
process become visible to the team no later than 24 hours after the problem occured.  This is due directly
to the standup.  Usually when a problem occurs the team member(s) that discover the problem may converse 
with the rest of the team right away but if not they will and should mention it in the next standup to occur.
I enjoyed this week and got to pair with the devlopers on a very cool project that has to do with satelites 
and airplanes.

Week 4: 6/20 - 6/24 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	This week I paired some more with the developers on the hydra team and I got to learn about and configure 
automated deployment jobs.  The automated jobs increase overall productivity of the development team by
automating the actions that developers would have to repeat over and over again.  This allows the team 
of  developers to focus more of their time on the actual development of a product rather than the processes 
that can be extracted and made autonomous.  This week was also exciting because I was able to ustilize some
of my Linux experiance in order to set up a QA environment for the Hydra development team (The team working 
with the satelites).  This was really fun for me because I was able to apply and see the value of knowledge 
that I have gained while at school.  Specifically the Linux Knowledge that I have gained over the last year.
I also discovered that on a given team not all developers have the same skills.  Some of the developers
on team Hydra for example have very limited Linux skills.  I think that that relization will be valuble in 
my career.

Week 5: 6/27 - 7/1 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	This week was as exciting as the last.
Week 6: 7/4 - 7/8 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 7: 7/11 - 7/15 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
